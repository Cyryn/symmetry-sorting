### Exit Interview Questions
- Have the participant fill out the Exit Interview Form

## Enter Data
- After the participant finishes sorting 20 images, make sure to use a post-it to keep the piles separated.

    - Set (B): Enter the Set numer here. This increases for each row of data
    - Image Numbers (C-V)
    - Set Size (W): # of Exemplars
  - Rows
    - There is 1 row for each pile that is created.
      - If a participant creates 4 piles, then there will be 4 rows of data
      - Enter the same participant number for each row of that dataset. 
      - Increase the Set number for each row of data
