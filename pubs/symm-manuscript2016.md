Methods  

Participants  

33 participants (9 Male, 24 Female), ranging in age between 18 and 35 completed this study. All participants had self reported 20/20 or corrected to 20/20 vision. We obtained written consent to participate from all participants under procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Pennsylvania State University (#38536).

Stimuli  

**From Shivam Thesis**
*Five wallpaper groups (P1, P3M1, P31M, P6, P6M) rated to be high in self-similarity, as determined by Clark et al (2011), were selected. 20 exemplars of each of these five wallpaper groups were created by tiling fundamental domains generated from random-dot white noise, resulting in a total of 100 distinct stimuli. These white noise fundamental domains had an area of ~4096 pixels, and were either square, rectangular, or triangular, depending on the symmetry group they represented. The advantages conferred by using white noise include the ability to generate numerous exemplars of the same wallpaper group and the absence of pattern discontinuities after tiling. These images were printed onto white cardstock and cut into squares, allowing participants to manipulate the orientation of the images during the sorting tasks. All stimuli are depicted (in reduced size) in Appendix A, organized by wallpaper group.*

Procedure  

Participants were presented with 20 exemplars of a single wallpaper group (P1, P3M1, P31M, P6, and P6M) and instructed to sort them into subgroups by placing them into piles. They were instructed to use whatever criteria they chose to create as many piles as necessary. There were no time constraints on this sorting task and the participants could move exemplars between subgroups until they were satisfied with the result. These tasks were carried out on a large table with sufficient space lay out all twenty exemplars, and illuminated by normal overhead room lighting. The order of the 5 groups was randomized as was the placement of the 20 exemplars for each group.

Upon completion of the sorting task, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to provide us with details regarding which features they used to group the images, was there a distinct method for sorting the images and if there was a group that was easier or harder to sort along with some demographic information.

Analysis  

The results of each subgroup created by the participant were logged by assigning a value of one (1) to each exemplar that was included in a subgroup or a value of zero (0) if it was not.
